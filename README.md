# Savannah Mercedes Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio that features current projects and work I have done, and gives access to my contact information and resume. This Portfolio was created with React and Tailwind css. Working on this project gave me more knowledge of React and Tailwind as it was my first time using both of these technologies! I was able to grasp the basic concepts of both.

## Usage

There is a navigation bar where you can click and be directed to a contact, Portfolio,and Resume page from the About page which serves as the homepage.
